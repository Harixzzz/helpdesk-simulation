# Helpdesk Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of an IT Helpdesk environment.  
It includes mock troubleshooting scenarios like:

- Login issues
- Network errors
- Email troubleshooting
- Password resets

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu Linux CLI
- Bash
- Simulated ticketing environment

## My Role
I practiced ticket-based problem-solving using real-world Linux and network commands in a self-hosted lab setup.
